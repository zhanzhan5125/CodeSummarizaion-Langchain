0,"This function is used to refresh OAuth2 tokens for accessing Reddit. It checks if the retry count is less than 5, and if not, raises a ConnectionAbortedError. Then it checks if the token is present and if the current time is greater than the valid until time minus the refresh margin. If so, it reads the config file and logs that a new token is found. It then sets the access credentials. If the force flag is set or the current time is greater than the valid until time minus the refresh margin, it logs that the token is being refreshed. It tries to refresh the access information using the refresh token and updates the token and valid until values. If there is an OAuthInvalidToken or HTTPException, it logs that a new token is requested and gets new access information.","This function refreshes OAuth2 tokens for accessing Reddit, handling errors and updating credentials as needed. It checks the retry count and raises an error if it exceeds 5. Then it checks token presence and validity. If necessary, it reads the config file, logs the discovery of a new token, and sets the access credentials. If forced or necessary, it logs the token refresh and updates the token and validity values.

2,"This function adds text to a PDF document. It takes in parameters such as the text to be added, the cursor position, and the justification of the text. If the cursor position is not specified, it defaults to the current cursor position on the page. The function also removes any extra whitespace in the text. If the text contains newline characters, it splits the text into multiple lines and adds each line separately. Otherwise, it adds the text as a single line.",as same as original answer,0,"[(4, ""The comment accurately summarizes the function's purpose and behavior, including default parameter handling, whitespace normalization, and newline character processing.
